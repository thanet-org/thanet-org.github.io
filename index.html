    <p>The Isle of Thanet is a historic and geographical area located on the northeastern tip of Kent, England. Situated between the North Sea to the east and the estuary of the River Thames to the north, the Isle of Thanet is characterized by its rich cultural heritage and strategic maritime position. Historically, it was an actual island separated from the mainland by the Wantsum Channel, which silted up over the centuries, transforming Thanet into a peninsula. The region has a long and varied history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to prehistoric times.
      <br><br>
      One of the Isle of Thanet's notable features is its significance in Anglo-Saxon history. It played a pivotal role during the migration period, as it is believed to be one of the first areas in England where the Anglo-Saxons settled. The presence of archaeological sites, such as the famous Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Monkton, attests to this early habitation. The area also features prominently in the writings of Bede, an eighth-century historian, who referred to Thanet as the landing place of the Anglo-Saxon leaders Hengist and Horsa.
